# Word-Guessing-Game
This is a simple Word Guessing Game written in Python that you can play in the terminal without a GUI. The game randomly chooses a word from a list and the player has to guess the word by inputting letters one at a time. The game ends when the player has guessed all the letters in the word or when they have used up all their guesses.

## How to Play
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned.
3. Run the command python word_guessing_game.py.
4. The game will start and you will be prompted to enter a letter to guess.
5. Keep guessing letters until you have guessed all the letters in the word or until you have used up all your guesses.

## Customization
If you want to add or remove words from the list of words that the game can choose from, you can modify the words list in the code.

`python words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "pear", "peach", "plum"]`

You can also customize the number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game ends by changing the value of the incorrect_guesses variable.

`python incorrect_guesses = 6`

Have fun playing!
